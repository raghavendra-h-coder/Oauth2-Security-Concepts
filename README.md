# Oauth2-Security-Concepts

This Project briefly describes how can we Implement Authorization server and Resource Server using Spring Security Oauth2 framework.

It contains two folders namely, 
1. AuthServerConcepts: This is the Authorization Server, which generates, stores and validates the access_tokens.
2. ResourceServerConcepts: This is the Resource Server, which contains resources. On before accessing the resources, every request is authorized using Authorization Server.
